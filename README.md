# Simulation-Exporter

This listener allows for automatically exports trajectories simulations in .csv files when the simulation finishes, saving some time if many simulations are to be executed and exported.

Current version is compatible with OpenRocket v15.03. The code has not been teste with OpenRocket v22, and may eventually be updated to work with it.

In order for the OpenRocket to recognize the listener, its path must be included in the classpath when running OpenRocket. This can be done in more than one way. For the installer version, you will find  "app/OpenRocket.cfg" in the installation directory of OpenRocket.

This program was developed in service for the Capital Rocket Team, it is made available for anyone to use, study, and extend as they will. Please, reference the team, or me, when using this software.
